  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  
  <h3>Q. What are your qualifications as a copywriter?</h3>
  <p>A. As a Music Therapist, I’ve been writing research papers and case studies for years. Now, I’ve learned to write persuasively through programs from American Writers and Artists (AWAI), the best writing training program on the market. I also belong to several group forums where we help each other improve our copy. Plus, I’ve read over 20 books on writing and marketing in the last year, alone… books like Influence by Robert Cialdini and Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Do you have experience in telemedicine?</h3>
  <p>A. I’ve worked in mental hospitals, nursing homes and schools. I’ve collaborated with doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, and I’m also a therapist myself. Plus, I’ve done remote audio and video coaching. I’m familiar with technology because I’ve trained others to use it, and I know how to explain technical jargon in simple language.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. What types of assignments do you handle?</h3>
  <p>A. As a web copywriter, I write website copy, landing pages, lead magnets,case studies, and more. I’m constantly growing my skills and adding new services. Please visit my services page for more information.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Do you offer social media management?</h3>
  <p>A. Yes, I’ll manage your social media accounts for 1-2 hours per day, 5 days per week. I can also set up social network profiles for you, if desired. My goal is to be a one-stop shot for your writing needs.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Your fee schedule lists a price for a ”Site Audit.” What’s this?</h3>
  <p>A. A Site Audit is a service where I review your existing website and determine how it compares to your competitors. I evaluate your copy and then give you a report with suggestions for improvements, as well as a roadmap explaining how you can implement these changes.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Speaking of money. What does it cost to hire you for a project?</h3>
  <p>A. My investment schedule is listed on the Services page, or you can contact me to receive an information packet. The investment schedule provides an estimate for several projects, which will vary depending on research time and project scope. </p>
  
  <h3>Q. I don’t see the service I need on your services page. What should I do?</h3>
  <p>A. The services list represents the projects that I’m most frequently hired to complete. However, please let me know what your goals are and what you need for your particular project, and I’ll let you know how I can help you.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Who are your clients…and what do they say about you?</h3>
  <p>A. Visit the testimonials and experience pages, or contact me for more information.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. How long will it take you to write my copy?</h3>
  <p>A. It typically takes me 10-14 business days once I start on your project. The amount of time necessary also depends on the amount of research required.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. What happens if we want you to revise the copy?</h3>
  <p>A. I’m happy to provide several rounds of revision, as needed. It usually only takes 1 or 2 rounds of revisions to reach a final copy that everyone is happy with. Find out more on my Writing Systems page.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. I have a tight deadline. Can you get started on my project right away?</h3>
  <p>A. I will do my best to accommodate your schedule. The answer will depend on factors including the scope of your project, the amount of research needed, availability of subject matter experts, and projects already scheduled at Copywriting for Healthcare. That is why I begin with a Discovery Questionnaire and consultation. Please contact me and request the Discovery Questionnaire.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. My business is located outside the U.S. Can we still work together?</h3>
  <p>A. Absolutely. My business is based in California, but I am able to serve clients internationally. Please email me and let me know what country you’re located in and how best to contact you. </p>
  
  <h3>Q. Why are you the best choice for my project?</h3>
  <p>A. My varied experiences in healthcare plus my technology knowledge will help me communicate clearly about your products and services. Plus, I’m passionate about improving healthcare, and I want to help you increase your profits and offer your services to more people.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. Do you have samples?</h3>
  <p>A. Yes, visit the samples page or contact me for more information.</p>
  
  <h3>Q. What is it like to work with you?</h3>
  <p>A. I pursue excellence in my work and go above and beyond to find ways to help you. One of my bosses told me “You are articulate, thoughtful, and punctual.” </p>
