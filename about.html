  <h2> About Craig </h2>
  <p> I’m a professional freelance copywriter for the healthcare industry. My goal is to help you communicate your product’s life-changing benefits. Whether you need sales copy or content, I’m here to help with your marketing. </p>
  <p> I’ve worked with nurses, psychiatrists, and other health professionals. I’ve had to convince them my therapeutic techniques would benefit their patients. I’ll use my persuasive skills to overcome skepticism and powerfully communicate benefits to your customers. </p>
  <p> I want to help increase your business because I’ve seen the difference healthcare can make. While working for a mental health facility, I helped mentally ill people to become fully functioning members of society. My family also uses pharmaceuticals and medical devices daily, and I’ve seen how much better their lives are because of modern medicine. I’ll use my conviction to convince your clients your products are the best to meet their needs. </p>
  <p> With a Bachelor’s in Music Therapy from University of the Pacific, I have a thorough understanding of scientific research. I utilize this knowledge when researching your product. If there is something I don’t understand, I research it until I do. </p>
  <p> I bring strong persuasive writing skills developed through American Writers and Artists Inc. (AWAI) copywriting courses. I also gained digital marketing skills when I raised $5,950 for the Western Region Music Therapy conference. My passion, enthusiasm, and creativity will benefit your project. </p>
  <p> Contact me today at Craig@HealthcareCopywriter.com to find out how I can help you. </p>
