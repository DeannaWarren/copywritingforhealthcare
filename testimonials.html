    <p>“You LISTEN very well. Being heard by you is a very precious experience because you’re very patient.” -Jan Swayne 
    </p>

    <p>“Craig was a great teacher to me. He’s also very articulate.” -Lisa Grad

    <p>“You’re really thoughtful and a great ear. You’re  also balanced, and you’re very rooted in who you are. You’re open-minded and compassionate, too.” -Casey Bernasconi
    </p>

    <p>“Patience is a strength of yours. Also, you have a thoughtfulness about you. You are a great listener, and you provide well thought-out answers.” -Marc R.</p>

    <p>“I feel like you’re an expert at being yourself. It shows when you bring your personal perspectives to things other people don’t think about, and you’re really inspiring for other people. Additionally, you have a lot of emotional endurance to keep going.” -Matt Kitagawa</p>

    <p>“Craig is one of the most thoughtful and patient people I know. Using       information he gleaned from trainings and teachers, he mastered a variety of software and hardware. Now, he’s hired to teach technology to students and their teachers. I am in awe of all he has accomplished.” 
    —Annie Chapin</p>

    <p>“Craig's patient, thoughtful manner encouraged me to face the frustrations I felt with the iPad. He demonstrated a genuine ability to carefully listen to my needs and provide articulate, clear explanations. I have the highest regard for Craig's intelligence, competency and character.”

    <p>"To this day, Craig is one of the most talented, motivated and hard-working students I have seen in my 10+ years in higher education. Craig's talents, creativity and advanced organizational skills prepared him to succeed at University of the Pacific. Despite concerns about his visual impairment, he absolutely excelled, and he impressed his faculty and peers along the way. Personally, watching Craig perform his senior piano recital from memory is something I will never forget. Further, Craig mentored another blind student and helped teach her how to navigate the campus, ensuring that she would also succeed.” - Daniel Nuss</p>
