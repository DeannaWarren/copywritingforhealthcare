  <p>The woods of the Santa Cruz mountains were a quiet and secluded place for Craig to grow up. In California, a state full of millions of people, it’s unusual to find such a remote area, where the nearest house was a quarter mile away. The house was a country cottage surrounded by redwood forests as far as the eye could see. Craig’s father was a software consultant who worked on financial systems for tech companies in Silicon Valley. His mother was a domestic goddess for Craig and his sister, and she also helped run the family business.
</p><p> As a young child, Craig would listen to stories and audiobooks for hours, much longer than any of his peers could sit still. While the other children at his pre-school were often slipping out the door and running across the street, troubling their teachers, Craig sat still, absorbed by stories and songs, instead.  When his mother would pick him up from daycare, the teacher commented that she couldn’t believe how Craig was content to sit still and focus on one thing for so long.
</p><p> While other children were reading Goose Bumps, the first book that Craig checked out of the library was Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Published in 1870 in French and translated to English, this book has many large words that a six-year-old was not familiar with. Rather than give up, Craig would ask his parents the meaning of words, and he learned to puzzle out the meanings of many words, as well. While his mother encouraged him to pick a different book, Craig persevered in reading the entire novel. Craig didn’t know it yet, but he had developed a love for learning anything and everything new and challenging— an important skill that would help him adjust to new situations and persevere at everything he put his mind to. 
</p><p> Craig was also a thoughtful and nonjudgmental listener, even when others were confrontational. For example, in seventh grade, Craig and another student wanted to start a GSA (gay-straight alliance) club at his school. In a meeting with his club advisor and the principal, the two teachers began arguing, and the advisor stormed out of the office. Craig remained calm and apologized for the uncomfortable situation. He was able to resolve this conflict and start the club. He went on to receive a leadership award at his eighth grade graduation ceremony. 
</p><p> After college, Craig interned at a state mental hospital, where he led Music Therapy sessions with adult patients. During one of these sessions, a patient took a guitar out of the storage closet. He began walking towards the group as if he were going to attack Craig with the instrument, but Craig was able to talk him down. This patient felt he wasn’t a valued member of the group, and when Craig alowed him to have a star role in the music that day, he was much calmer and more cooperative. Craig used his listening skills to benefit his patients at nursing homes, and schools, as well. Nonjudgmental listening helps Craig hear beyond what people say to what they actually mean. He loves using his listening skills to discover how he can improve himself and help others be the best they can be. 
</p><p> Craig currently works as a freelance copywriter, specializing in web copywriting, social media and email marketing. Craig still loves technology consulting for teachers, students and members of the community by phone. He enjoys these opportunities to find new ways to use tech to help people live better lives. Craig says “I love copywriting because I get to learn about new technology, and I then creatively communicate how it helps other people.” For more information about how Craig can improve your profits through clear communication, Craig can be reached directly at (209)-883-6600, or by email at craig@CopywritingForHealthcare.com. </p>
