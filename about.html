    <h2>Getting to Know Craig</h2>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The first book Craig checked out of the library was Jules Verne’s <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em>. Craig was encouraged to pick a new book, but he persisted, asking his parents to look up many unfamiliar words no one knew. </p>
        <p>Craig developed a love for learning anything and everything new and challenging— a skill that helps him explain complicated subjects in simple terms. </p>

        <p> In seventh grade, Craig wanted to start a GSA (gay-straight alliance) club. In a meeting with his club advisor and the principal, the two teachers began arguing, and the advisor stormed out. </p>
        <p>Because Craig calmly apologized for the uncomfortable situation, he was able to resolve this conflict, start the club, and receive a leadership award.</p>

        <p>   As a Music Therapist, Craig shared his love for music in mental hospitals, nursing homes and schools. Craig helped his patients by listening to their stories and helping them express themselves through music. Nonjudgmental listening helps Craig meet his client’s needs and exceed their expectations. </p>

        <p>   Craig currently works as a freelance healthcare copywriter, specializing in web copy. Craig says, “I love learning about you and creatively communicating how your company helps others.” </p>
